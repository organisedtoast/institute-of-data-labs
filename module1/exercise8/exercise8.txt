USER STORY

A. Choose a dice

User sees a list of 2 dice options (e.g. D6, D10).

User selects one dice type so the app knows what it is rolling.

App shows user which dice is currently selected so user doesn't get confused.

B. Roll the dice

User has to press a Roll button so they can roll their selected dice.

App shows user the result number after they roll.

User wants result to be random and within the correct range (e.g. Dice 6 gives a number from 1–6; Dice 10 gives a number 1–10).

C. Basic error protection

The app must not roll if no dice has been selected. That way there won't be errors.
