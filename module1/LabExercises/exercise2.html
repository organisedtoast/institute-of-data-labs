        <h1>Lab Exercise 2</h1>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Practice HTML structure and file management on VS Code</p>
    </header>

    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>My very first HTML sheet created on VS Code</h2>

            <p>This HTML text was styled without using any CSS, as that is too hard for a beginner:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Open VS Code:</strong> I opened (or created) a Module1 folder in VS Code.<br><br></li>

                <li><strong>Create Directory:</strong> I used the Terminal feature of VS Code to issue commands to
                    create a
                    new folder inside Module1 for LabExercises and change into it.<br><br></li>

                <li><strong>Create File:</strong> Inside the above folder, I create a new file called
                    exercise2.html<br><br></li>

                <li><strong>HTML Skeleton:</strong> As the first character in this file, I typed an exclamation mark !
                    and
                    used the Emmet abbreviation (tab key) to generate a basic HTML skeleton<br><br></li>

                <li><strong>Populate Content:</strong> I populated the &lt;body&gt; with basic HTML representing these
                    lab
                    steps<br><br></li>

                <li><strong>Augment code with Qwen Coder Companion:</strong> I instructed Qwen to make the text more
                    visually appealing using semantic HTML elements and without resorting to any CSS styling.
                    <br><br>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Preview:</strong> I went Live to view and test the HTML<br><br></li>

                <li><strong>Format Code:</strong> I installed the Prettier VSCode extension and formatted my code base
                    with
                    Ctrl-K-F<br><br></li>

                <li><strong>Additional Reading:</strong> I read through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Dealing_with_files">Dealing with files</a> on Mozilla Developer Network for more tips
                    about
                    website file systems.<br><br></li>
