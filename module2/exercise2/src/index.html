  <h1>My CSS nightmare</h1>

  <article>
    <h2>I. Selectors</h2>

    <section>
      <p class="style-me1">
        I nudged one margin — the whole page took flight,
      </p>
      <p id="style-me2">
        One tiny tweak turned day design to night,
      </p>
      <p id="style-me2" class="style-me1">
        CSS wins every single fight.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="my-children-are-styled">
      <h3>2.1 Direct &lt;p&gt; children are styled</h3>
      <div>
        <p>I used the child combinator like a CSS pro (this is nested, so won't be affected by child combinator styling),</p>
      </div>
      <p>One tiny > out of place — and the styles refuse to show.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="my-descendants-are-styled">
      <h3>2.2 All descendants &lt;p&gt; are styled</h3>
      <div>
        <p>I chained five descendants like a wizard of lore,</p>
      </div>
      <p>Missed one tiny space — and nothing matched anymore.</p>
    </section>
  </article>

    <h2>II. Box model and common properties</h2>
    <div class="box">I set the width to 200 — felt clever, precise, <br> then padding and border said, “Add us twice!”</div>
    <div class="box">
      I set a tidy width — two hundred on the nose, <br> 
Declared, “This box is perfect!” — that’s how the story goes. <br> 
Then padding strolled in softly, border joined the scene,<br> 
And suddenly my “perfect” box was bursting at the seam.<br> <br> 

I whispered, “Box-sizing: border-box,” like casting ancient lore,<br> 
The layout stopped exploding… but then I added more.<br> 
A margin here, a margin there, a nudge to make it neat,<br> 
And somehow now the footer lives halfway up the street.<br> 
    </div>
    <div class="box" style="height: 200px">
      Flexbox tried to help me — “Relax, I’ll align!”<br>
But justify-content and I can’t read the same sign.<br>
I center things horizontally, vertically I plead,<br>
The box just shrugs and wanders off with reckless flexbox speed.<br><br>

I add a shadow, rounded corners, gradients for some flair,<br>
Now it looks like modern art — but why’s it over there?<br>
Inspect tool open, twenty divs deep in the tree,<br>
One rogue inherited style is mocking me.<br><br>

</div>

    <h2>III. Positioning</h2>
    <div class="position-absolute">I set it to absolute — and it vanished with attitude.</div>

    <div class="position-relative">
      I set it to relative — and it moved, but only emotionally.
      <div class="position-absolute">I'm absolutely positioned inside a relative container.</div>
    </div>
  </article>
  <div class="position-sticky">I'm a sticky positioned floating CSS progress monitor.</div>

  <article>
    <h2>IV. Styling text</h2>
    <p class="text-style">
      I chose font-family “DM Sans” refined and sleek, <br>
The browser shrugged and gave me sans-serif all week. <br>
I set font-weight bold 700 in might, <br>
It still looks slightly wrong — but technically right?
    </p>

    <h2>V. Styling links</h2>

    <h2>VI. calc()</h2>
    <div class="calc-style">

I wrote calc(100% - 20px) feeling smug and wise, <br>
Like maths and style had formed a grand alliance. <br>
The layout shifted left — then down — then back again, <br>
Turns out I forgot the spaces… CSS said “nope” once more, my friend.

          </div>

    <div class="calc-row">

      <div class="cat-fixed-width-col">
       
        <img src="../assets/images/img1.png" width="350" />
      
      </div>

      <div class="cat-text-fluid-col"> 
        This text should expand to fill 'the rest' of the page width not used by the image inside the cat-fixed-width-col class element. 
        This text should expand to fill 'the rest' of the page width not used by the image inside the cat-fixed-width-col class element.

  <div style="height: 1000px; background: #AA99CC">
    I'm here just for height, to fill in extra space and pretend that the website is longer than it really is :).
